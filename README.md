Small engineering project for second year in CentraleSup√©lec.

Objective: a smart watch that gets GPS data point and then upload to the computer. We tested different techniques to optimize battery consumption.

What to do:
- upload corresponding module in ESP32
- use	'generate_table_module_4_wifi.py' to generate conversion table used in module 4
- use 'post_treatment.py' to upload data from ESP32 to computer

Additional note: you can simulate all the simulation on the computer only using Runtastic GPS data and 'from_runtastic_to_post_treatment.py'
